Blackjack is a casino style Blackjack card game with betting logic. The goal of Blackjack is to get closest to the total of 21 without going over. The player starts with $2,000 and must first make a bet before the cards can be dealt. After the player makes a bet of their choice, the player and dealer are both dealt two cards out of a shuffled deck, with the dealers first card dealt being face down. The card values are listed below. If the player has a total of 21 with their inital two cards, they have Blackjack are are paid $3 for every $2 bet or 3/2 odds. After the cards are dealt, the player has the choice to "hit" or "stand.  When the player "hits", they are dealt an additional card that is added to their total. If the player card total is over 21, they "bust" and the round is over. When a player "stands", it is the dealers turn. The dealer will automatically stand if their total is between 17 and 20, or they have 21, and the game will compare scores to check for a winner. Whichever card total, players or dealers, is closest to 21 wins. If player wins they are paid $2 for every $1 they bet, or 2/1 odds. If both players have the same total of cards, the game is a "push" and the player gets their initial bet back. The game is over when the players bank reaches zero. The player then has the option to play again and their bank will refill and the cards will reshuffle.
